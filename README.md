# Tylo-Source-Code
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is Tylo's Source Code, this bot was made by Loop#3089. If you want to selfhost I don't mind but as you see!

This was purely made out of boredem I didn't expect myself to operate on this Bot's source code for several weeks, in around maybe 2 months I've accomplished this so far I do expect do make an better economy but right now I'm really trash with databases. One day Tylo will have a custom economy but that will be in the future.

If any errors happen DM Loop#3089 on Discord, I am active from the time 3PM-9PM.

Good luck have a great day!

Some commands included are a screenshot,trivia and economy commands. Their is a level system that I plan on improving but right now I'm at the basics of Python and learnt of Tutorials!

AutoModeration:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you say a word containing any profanity it will be deleted I made a way that it doesn't by adding a role that won't be tagged you can adjust the name to whatever you want same with the link detection. To do that you must change rolenam = "YOUR ROLE NAME" then it shall work.

By the way you'll need Youtube-DL and FFMPEG to use the music cog and you'll need a file path for FFMPEG or else no sound will be played.
